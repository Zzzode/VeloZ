  short: Trade trend changes using MACD line and signal line crossovers.
  long: |
    The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Crossover strategy uses the
    relationship between two moving averages to identify trend changes. When the
    MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a buy signal. When it
    crosses below, it generates a sell signal.

    MACD is one of the most popular technical indicators, combining trend-following
    and momentum characteristics. It works well in trending markets and helps
    identify the strength and direction of price movements.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate MACD line (fast EMA - slow EMA)
    2. Calculate Signal line (EMA of MACD line)
    3. Calculate Histogram (MACD - Signal)
    4. Buy when MACD crosses above Signal line
    5. Sell when MACD crosses below Signal line
    6. Optionally confirm with histogram direction or zero-line crossover
