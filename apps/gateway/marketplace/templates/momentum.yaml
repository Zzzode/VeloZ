description:
  short: Follow strong price trends by buying assets showing upward momentum and selling those showing downward momentum.
  long: |
    Momentum trading is based on the principle that assets that have been rising tend
    to continue rising, and those falling tend to continue falling. The strategy
    identifies assets with strong recent performance and takes positions in the
    direction of the trend.

    This strategy uses rate of change (ROC) and relative strength indicators to
    measure momentum. It works best in trending markets and can capture significant
    moves, but requires careful risk management to avoid whipsaws.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate momentum using Rate of Change (ROC) over the lookback period
    2. When momentum exceeds the entry threshold, enter a long position
    3. When momentum falls below negative entry threshold, enter a short position
    4. Exit when momentum weakens below the exit threshold
    5. Use trailing stops to protect profits during strong trends
    6. Apply position sizing based on momentum strength
  when_to_use:
    - Strong trending markets
    - After breakouts from consolidation
    - When volatility is increasing
    - During market momentum phases
  when_not_to_use:
    - Ranging or choppy markets
    - During consolidation periods
    - When trends are exhausted
    - High-frequency reversals
