description:
  short: Profit from price oscillations within a defined range using a grid of buy and sell orders.
  long: |
    Grid trading places buy and sell orders at regular price intervals above and below
    a set price, creating a "grid" of orders. When price oscillates within the range,
    the strategy captures profits from each completed buy-sell cycle.

    This strategy works best in ranging or sideways markets where price moves within
    a predictable range without strong directional trends.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Define a price range with upper and lower bounds
    2. Divide the range into equal grid levels
    3. Place buy orders at each level below current price
    4. Place sell orders at each level above current price
    5. When a buy order fills, place a sell order one grid level up
    6. When a sell order fills, place a buy order one grid level down
    7. Repeat to capture profits from price oscillations
  when_to_use:
    - Ranging or sideways markets
    - High volatility within a defined range
    - When you expect price to oscillate without strong trends
    - Stable market conditions without major news events
  when_not_to_use:
    - Strong trending markets (up or down)
    - During major news events or announcements
    - Low liquidity conditions
    - When expecting a breakout

risks:
  - "Price breaking out of grid range can cause significant unrealized losses"
  - "Trending markets may leave you holding losing positions at grid extremes"
