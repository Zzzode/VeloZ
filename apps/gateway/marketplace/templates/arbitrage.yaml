  short: Profit from price differences of the same asset across different exchanges.
  long: |
    Cross-Exchange Arbitrage exploits price discrepancies between different exchanges.
    When the same asset trades at different prices on two exchanges, the strategy
    buys on the cheaper exchange and sells on the more expensive one, capturing
    the price difference as profit.

    This strategy requires accounts on multiple exchanges with pre-funded balances.
    Profits are typically small per trade but can accumulate with high frequency.
    Speed and low latency are critical for success.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Monitor prices on multiple exchanges simultaneously
    2. Calculate potential profit after fees and slippage
    3. When profit exceeds minimum threshold, execute simultaneously:
       - Buy on the cheaper exchange
       - Sell on the more expensive exchange
    4. Rebalance positions periodically to maintain trading capacity
    5. Account for withdrawal/deposit times for position management
  when_to_use:
    - When price discrepancies exist between exchanges
    - High-volume assets with good liquidity on multiple venues
    - When you have fast, reliable connectivity to exchanges
    - With sufficient capital on multiple exchanges
  when_not_to_use:
    - During extreme market volatility
    - When exchange APIs are unreliable
    - Without sufficient capital on both exchanges
    - When withdrawal/deposit is restricted
