  short: Buy when price deviates below the mean and sell when it returns, profiting from price normalization.
  long: |
    Mean Reversion is based on the statistical concept that prices tend to return to
    their average over time. When price deviates significantly from its historical
    mean (measured in standard deviations), the strategy takes a position expecting
    price to revert back.

    This strategy works well in ranging markets where prices oscillate around a
    central value. It requires careful parameter tuning to balance between catching
    genuine reversions and avoiding false signals.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate the moving average (mean) over a lookback period
    2. Calculate the standard deviation of prices
    3. When price falls below mean by entry_threshold standard deviations, buy
    4. When price rises above mean by entry_threshold standard deviations, sell short
    5. Exit when price returns to within exit_threshold of the mean
    6. Use stop-loss to limit losses if price continues moving away from mean
  when_to_use:
    - Ranging or mean-reverting markets
    - Assets with historical tendency to revert to mean
    - When volatility is elevated but not trending
    - After sharp price movements that seem overdone
  when_not_to_use:
    - Strong trending markets
    - During fundamental shifts in asset value
    - Low liquidity conditions
    - When volatility is extremely high (potential regime change)

risks:
  - "Price may not revert to mean (regime change or trend continuation)"
  - "Multiple losing trades possible in trending markets"
  - "Stop-loss may be hit frequently in high volatility"
  - "Mean itself shifts over time, requiring parameter adjustment"
  - "Correlation breakdown during market stress"
