  short: Accumulate assets over time by investing fixed amounts at regular intervals.
  long: |
    Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed
    amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price. This
    approach reduces the impact of volatility by spreading purchases over time.

    DCA is ideal for long-term accumulation and helps avoid the emotional pitfalls
    of trying to time the market. You buy more when prices are low and less when
    prices are high, resulting in a lower average cost over time.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Set a fixed investment amount (e.g., $100)
    2. Choose an investment frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
    3. Set the total duration or number of purchases
    4. The strategy automatically buys at each interval
    5. Track your average purchase price over time
    6. Optionally set a take-profit target to sell accumulated assets
  when_to_use:
    - Long-term asset accumulation
    - When you believe in the asset's long-term value
    - To reduce timing risk and emotional decision-making
    - Building a position gradually over time
    - When you have regular income to invest
  when_not_to_use:
    - Short-term trading goals
    - When you need quick returns
    - In clearly declining markets (consider waiting)
    - When you need the capital for other purposes
