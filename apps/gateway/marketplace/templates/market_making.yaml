  short: Provide liquidity by placing buy and sell orders around the current price, earning the spread.
  long: |
    Market Making is a strategy that provides liquidity to the market by continuously
    placing both buy and sell orders around the current market price. The strategy
    profits from the bid-ask spread while managing inventory risk.

    This strategy requires careful management of inventory (position) to avoid
    accumulating too much exposure in one direction. It works best in liquid markets
    with stable volatility.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate fair value based on mid-price or VWAP
    2. Place buy orders below fair value (bid side)
    3. Place sell orders above fair value (ask side)
    4. Adjust spread based on volatility and inventory
    5. When orders fill, replace them to maintain quotes
    6. Manage inventory to stay within risk limits
    7. Widen spreads during high volatility
  when_to_use:
    - Liquid markets with tight spreads
    - Stable volatility conditions
    - When you can provide competitive quotes
    - Markets with consistent trading activity
  when_not_to_use:
    - During major news events
    - In illiquid markets
    - When volatility is extremely high
    - When you cannot monitor continuously
