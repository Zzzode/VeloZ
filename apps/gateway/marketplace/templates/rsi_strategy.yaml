  short: Buy when RSI indicates oversold conditions and sell when overbought, capturing mean reversion moves.
  long: |
    The RSI (Relative Strength Index) strategy uses the popular momentum oscillator
    to identify overbought and oversold conditions. When RSI falls below the oversold
    level (typically 30), it signals a potential buying opportunity. When RSI rises
    above the overbought level (typically 70), it signals a potential selling opportunity.

    This is a classic mean reversion strategy that works well in ranging markets
    where prices oscillate between support and resistance levels.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate RSI over the specified period
    2. When RSI falls below oversold level, enter a long position
    3. When RSI rises above overbought level, enter a short position (or exit long)
    4. Exit when RSI returns to neutral zone (around 50)
    5. Use stop-loss to limit losses if price continues against position
  when_to_use:
    - Ranging markets with clear support/resistance
    - When price is oscillating without strong trend
    - After sharp price movements that seem overdone
    - In markets with mean-reverting characteristics
  when_not_to_use:
    - Strong trending markets
    - During breakouts
    - When fundamentals are changing
    - In highly volatile conditions
