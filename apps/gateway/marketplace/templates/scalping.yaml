  short: Capture small price movements with frequent trades and tight risk management.
  long: |
    Scalping is a high-frequency trading strategy that aims to profit from small
    price movements by making many trades throughout the day. Each trade targets
    a small profit, but the cumulative effect of many successful trades can be
    significant.

    This strategy requires excellent execution, low latency, and tight spreads.
    It's best suited for liquid markets with high trading volume. Risk management
    is critical as losses can accumulate quickly.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Monitor order book for imbalances and momentum
    2. Enter positions when detecting short-term momentum
    3. Target small profits (0.1-0.3% per trade)
    4. Use tight stop losses to limit downside
    5. Exit quickly - hold positions for seconds to minutes
    6. Manage position sizing to control risk
