description:
  short: Trade volatility breakouts when price breaks through Bollinger Bands.
  long: |
    The Bollinger Bands strategy uses price volatility to identify potential
    breakout opportunities. Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (moving average)
    and upper/lower bands set at a specified number of standard deviations.

    This strategy can be used in two ways: mean reversion (fade moves to the bands)
    or breakout (trade in direction of band breaks). This template implements the
    breakout approach, entering when price breaks through the bands with momentum.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate the middle band (SMA over the period)
    2. Calculate upper band (middle + std_dev * standard deviations)
    3. Calculate lower band (middle - std_dev * standard deviations)
    4. Enter long when price closes above upper band with volume confirmation
    5. Enter short when price closes below lower band with volume confirmation
    6. Exit when price returns to middle band or opposite band
    7. Use band width for volatility filtering
  when_to_use:
    - After periods of low volatility (band squeeze)
    - When expecting volatility expansion
    - During breakout setups
    - In markets with clear support/resistance
  when_not_to_use:
    - During very high volatility (bands too wide)
    - In choppy, directionless markets
    - When bands are extremely narrow for extended periods
    - During major news events

risks:
  - "False breakouts can lead to quick losses"

  - "Squeeze periods can last longer than expected"
  - "Mean reversion mode can catch falling knives"
  - "High volatility can trigger stop losses quickly"
