description:
  short: Trade overbought and oversold conditions using the Stochastic Oscillator indicator.
  long: |
    The Stochastic Oscillator strategy uses the relationship between a closing price
    and its price range over a given period to identify potential reversal points.
    The indicator consists of two lines: %K (fast) and %D (slow signal line).

    When both lines are below 20 and %K crosses above %D, it generates a buy signal.
    When both lines are above 80 and %K crosses below %D, it generates a sell signal.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate %K = (Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
    2. Calculate %D = SMA of %K over signal period
    3. When %K crosses above %D in oversold zone (< 20), buy
    4. When %K crosses below %D in overbought zone (> 80), sell
    5. Exit when opposite signal occurs or at target/stop
  when_to_use:
    - Ranging markets
    - When looking for reversal signals
    - Combined with trend filters
    - In markets with clear support/resistance
  when_not_to_use:
    - Strong trending markets
    - During breakouts
    - When volatility is extremely high
