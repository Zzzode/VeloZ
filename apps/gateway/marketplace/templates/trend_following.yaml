  short: Follow market trends using moving average crossovers to identify trend changes.
  long: |
    The Trend Following strategy uses the crossover of two moving averages to
    identify and follow market trends. When the fast moving average crosses above
    the slow moving average, it signals an uptrend. When it crosses below, it
    signals a downtrend.

    This is one of the most time-tested trading strategies, used by professional
    traders for decades. It aims to capture the middle portion of trends while
    avoiding the noise of short-term price movements.
  how_it_works: |
    1. Calculate a fast moving average (shorter period)
    2. Calculate a slow moving average (longer period)
    3. When fast MA crosses above slow MA, enter long position
    4. When fast MA crosses below slow MA, exit long and optionally enter short
    5. Stay in position until opposite crossover occurs
    6. Use trailing stops to protect profits during strong trends
  when_to_use:
    - Trending markets with clear direction
    - Medium to long-term trading horizons
    - When you want to capture major market moves
    - After breakouts from consolidation
  when_not_to_use:
    - Ranging or sideways markets
    - Very short timeframes
    - During choppy market conditions
    - When expecting quick reversals
